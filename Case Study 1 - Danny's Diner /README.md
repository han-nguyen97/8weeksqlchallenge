# Case Study 1 - Danny's Diner
<img src="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/case-study-designs/1.png" width = "600">

## Introduction

Danny decides to open a Japanese restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen in the beginning of 2021. However, the restaurant has captured some very basic data from the initial months of operation but have no idea to use their data to help improve the business.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer some questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. 

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

- Sales
- Menu
- Members

## Case Study Questions & Solutions
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,
      SUM(dannys_diner.menu.price) AS Total_Amount
FROM dannys_diner.menu
RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.sales
ON dannys_diner.menu.product_id = dannys_diner.sales.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

- FROM clause: From the question, I mainly focus on sales table, then I join it with the menu table to retrieve price data based on product_id as it serves as a common identifier between them.<br>
- GROUP BY clause: Then I group data based on customer_id to calculate the total amount.<br>
- SELECT statement: I use SUM function to calculate total amount spent by customers and include customer_id in the final result

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
      COUNT( DISTINCT order_date) AS Time_Visited
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

- FROM clause: Retrieve data from the sales table.<br>
- GROUP BY clause: Group data based on customer_id to calculate the time visited .<br>
- SELECT statement: The COUNT function and DISTINCT were used to calculate the number of times a customer visits a restaurant based on order_date

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```sql
--- Create a temporary table to track which products each customer ordered
WITH menu_sales AS (
SELECT customer_id,
            order_date,
            sales.product_id,
            product_name, 
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS rank
FROM dannys_diner.menu
RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.sales
ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id,  product_name
FROM menu_sales
WHERE rank = 1;
```

- WITH clause: This part creates a temporary table called menu_sales by combining two tables sales and menu. The DENSE_RANK() assigns a rank to each order for each customer based on order_date.  The earliest purchase from each customer gets a rank 1. If there is more than 1 purchase per date per customer, all of the orders from that customer get the same number.<br>
- SELECT statement: Specifies the columns that will be presented in the final result. It includes customer_id and product_name.<br>
- WHERE clause: Filters the result to include only rows with rank equals to 1. This ensures that only the first item from the menu on the first order date will be shown.

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
```sql
SELECT product_name, 
      COUNT(*) AS Purchased_Time
FROM dannys_diner.menu
RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.sales
ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY Purchased_Time DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;
```

- FROM Clause: This part combines two tables menu and product based on the common identifier product_id.<br>
- GROUP BY Clause: To calculate the number of purchasing time, the data was grouped by product_name.<br>
- SELECT statement: The COUNT function was used to calculate the number of times each product was purchased and product_name was also selected from the table.<br>
- ORDER BY Clause: This orders the result set by Purchased_Time in descending order.<br>
- OFFSET-FETCH Clause: This part limits the number of rows returned by the query, ensuring that only the the top product was retrieved

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```sql
-- Create a table including customer, product and popular product rank
WITH popular_product_within_customer AS
  (SELECT customer_id, 
				  product_name, 
				  COUNT (*) AS Nbr_Order,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY COUNT (*) DESC) AS popular_rank
  FROM dannys_diner.menu
  RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.sales
  ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id
  GROUP BY customer_id, product_name)

-- Select the first popular product rank from the table created above
SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM popular_product_within_customer
WHERE popular_rank = 1;
```

- WITH clause: This part creates a temporary table called popular_product_within_customer by combining two tables sales and menu using the common identifier product_id. The DENSE_RANK() assigns a rank to each product for each customer based on number of times the product was ordered - COUNT(*).  The highest number of times q product was ordered ranks 1.
- SELECT statement: Specifies the columns that will be presented in the final result. It includes customer_id and product_name
- WHERE clause: Filters the result to include only rows with rank equals to 1. This ensures that only the most popular product (the product which ordered most times by each customer) was shown.
  
**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
```sql
-- Create a table containing data after each customer became member (including joining date)
WITH sales_members AS
  (SELECT sales.customer_id, 
				  join_date, 
				  order_date, 
				  product_name,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS order_rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.members
  ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  WHERE join_date <= order_date)
  
SELECT customer_id, join_date, order_date, product_name
FROM sales_members
WHERE order_rank = 1;
```
![image](https://github.com/han-nguyen97/8weeksqlchallenge/assets/83593831/f9c8e822-dd4b-46ae-bfc0-0ddb8354a8bb)

- WITH clause: This part creates a temporary table called sales_members by combining two tables sales and menu using the common identifier product_id. The WHERE Clause ensures that the table only contains data after each customer became member (including joining date). The DENSE_RANK() assigns a rank to each order based on the ascending order of order_date, meaning that the oldest order ranks first.
- SELECT statement: Specifies the columns that will be presented in the final result. It includes customer_id, join_date, order_date, product_name
- WHERE clause: Filters the result to include only rows with rank equals to 1. This ensures that only the first order was shown.
  
**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
```sql
-- Create a table containing data before each customer became member 
WITH sales_members AS
  (SELECT sales.customer_id,
            join_date,
            order_date,
            product_name,
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS order_rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.members
  ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  WHERE join_date > order_date)
  
SELECT customer_id,
      join_date,
      order_date,
      product_name
FROM sales_members
WHERE order_rank = 1;
```

![image](https://github.com/han-nguyen97/8weeksqlchallenge/assets/83593831/def65be8-94a1-425c-af1f-cb0069435da4)

- WITH clause: This part creates a temporary table called sales_members by combining two tables sales and menu using the common identifier product_id. The WHERE Clause ensures that the table only contains data before each customer becomes member. The DENSE_RANK() assigns a rank to each order based on the descending order of order_date, meaning that the latest order ranks first.
- WHERE clause: Filters the result to include only rows with rank equals to 1. This ensures that only the latest order was shown.
- - SELECT statement: Specifies the columns that will be presented in the final result. It includes customer_id, join_date, order_date, product_name
  
**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
```sql
SELECT sales.customer_id,
      COUNT(*) AS Total_Items,
      SUM(price) AS Total_Amount
FROM dannys_diner.sales
RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.members
ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE join_date > order_date
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/han-nguyen97/8weeksqlchallenge/assets/83593831/9f10dcaf-ce43-4ad0-8d42-0ed99517c5de)

- FROM Clause: The three tables sales, members, menu were joined to retrieve items and amount spent for each member using common identifiers customer_id and product_id.
- WHERE Clause: The condition join_date > order_date was included to ensure only data of  members were shown
- GROUP BY Clause: The data was grouped by customer_id to calculate the requiring data
- SELECT statement: THE COUNT() and SUM() functions were used to calculate the total items were ordered and the total amount each customer spent.

**9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
```sql
SELECT sales.customer_id,
  SUM(
  CASE 
	  WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN price * 10 * 2
	  ELSE price * 10
  END) AS Total_Points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/han-nguyen97/8weeksqlchallenge/assets/83593831/68fe9b0b-006b-4793-bf87-4c3b81e7abbd)

- FROM Clause: To calculate the points for each customer, we need the sales and menu tables to know which product each customer was ordered. The two tables were joined using product_id as a common identifier.
- GROUP BY Clause: This groups the results by customer_id. The SUM function will then calculate the total points for each customer based on their purchases.
- CASE â€¦ WHEN Statement: This CASE Statement checks if the product_name was sushi, then it multiplies the price by 10 and 2. If not, it multiplies the price by 10. This ensures that sushi receives double points. 
- SELECT Statement: The CASE â€¦ WHEN Statement was wrapped in SUM function to calculate total point for each customer.

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
```sql
SELECT sales.customer_id,
  SUM(
  CASE 
      WHEN order_date < DATEADD(week, 1, join_date) THEN price * 10 * 2
      ELSE price * 10
  END) AS Member_Points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
RIGHT JOIN dannys_diner.members
ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE join_date <= order_date
AND order_date <= '2021-01-31'
GROUP BY sales.customer_id,
            join_date;
```

- FROM Clause: To calculate the points for each member, we need the sales, members and menu tables to know which product each member was ordered. The three tables were joined using customer_id and product_id as the common identifiers.
- WHERE Clause: The condition join_date <= order_date ensures that only data after the customer becomes member was retrieved. To calculate the points at the end of January, order_date <= '2021-01-31' was included in the condition.
- GROUP BY Clause: The query correctly groups by customer_id and join_date to ensure proper aggregation of points.
SUM(CASE ... END) AS Member_Points: Calculates the total points earned by each customer with a CASE statement. The DATEADD() function calculates the one week after the join date. If the order was made within one week after joining data, the members earn double points. Otherwise, they earn regular points.
- SELECT Statement: The final result includes customer_id and member_points.
